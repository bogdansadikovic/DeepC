# DeepC Project Overview:
DeepC is a C/C++ Framework to assist programmers in building Deep Learning models. 

DeepC includes two versions: DeepC and DeepCimple (Should be read as DeepSimple, but I tried to be funny).
This framework is created by me, a college student in an attempt to learn how deep learning works, and to create my own framework, while also creating something that someone hopefully finds useful one day. (That's you :) )

I feel that C is an underrated language that deserves a lot more attention than it currently does. While languages like Python are very convenient and useful for quickly creating applications, and with easier-to-understand code, languages like C and C++ allow for users to have a better understanding of the computer, and of how progrmaming as a whole works. Unpopular opinion, but I think C is the best starter language. If you didn't suffer when you started programming, you didn't learn it right in my opinion (just kidding learn however fits you best :) ). But on a serious note, C's difficutly often puts people off from doing any sort of Machine Learning and Deep learning, especially due to its lack of things like classes, and certain functions which make ML/DL much easier in Python. 


# DeepCimple:

DeepCimple is a lightweight version of the DeepC program. It does the same stuff as DeepC, but without the built-in models and with a few functions removed. This was done so that people working on lighter projects, or just looking for a quick way to save their own models can do it without having to download too large a file. This is meant for those who already know how to do Machine Learning, and are comfortable with the mathematics and topics behind all of it. It basically only has functions for saving and loading models, and some helper functions for Neural Networks. It is, thus, much smaller than the real DeepC framework, but helpful for those who don't want to deal with having to convert models to binary files, and then reading them from binary files. 



# DeepC:

DeepC is the full and main program, featuring all the things from DeepCimple (i.e., saving/loading models, functions to deal with NNs, etc.), along with other features that help users learn the basics of Deep Learning, with a more easy introduction into the concept that isn't too overbearing (especially on a language like C). This framework holds within it a bunch of pre-built models that can be used by users to train, and create applications with. It also has a lot of built-in functions to help make creating your own models easier, and helping people initialize functions. 

**IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS HAS NOT YET BEEN FINISHED OR PUBLISHED, ONLY HERE TO GIVE AS A HEADS-UP ON WHAT IS TO COME. SORRY IF THIS INCONVENIENCES ANYONE IN ANY WAY.**




# Credits:

This framework is not made without the help of awesome people who created their own libraries that allow DeepC to work as well as it does. Below are the libraries that DeepC and DeepCimple use, as well as their GitHub repositories (Please check them out, they're really awesome people for making these libraries!):
